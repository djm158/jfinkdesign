        The resources offered by Career Services, such as one-on-one sessions,
        career fair events, portfolio reviews, and classroom
        presentations/seminars, do not reach graduate students in the same way
        as they reach undergraduates, which reduces the probability of graduate
        students getting a job during and/or after graduation.

        Evolve is a new and improved job search site for Jefferson students with
        the purpose of increasing the amount of students that apply and get

        Your company’s leadership team has identified spot or downturn in the
        performance of a particular Product/Service and they’ve asked you to
        figure out what might be wrong and how they should fix it. Outline the
